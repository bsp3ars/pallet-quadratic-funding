As a crowdfunder, I want to be able to use the application to fund a project and know that my funding will be honestly matched.

As a crowdfunded project, I don't want other projects to recieve more funding because they bribed voters or collude.

As an entity who is matching crowdfunded projects, I want the funds to be to be distributed democraticly, fair, and honest.
