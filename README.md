## Resources for learning

### Substrate

- [All Substrate Tutorials](https://substrate.dev/en/tutorials) - only worry about these two for now
  - [Create Your First Substrate Chain](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain/): need Rust installed but no Rust experiencez
  - [Add a Pallet to Your Runtime](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/add-a-pallet/): slightly more advanced
- [Substrate Kitties](https://substrate.dev/substrate-how-to-guides/docs/tutorials/Kitties/overview): Build Cryptokitties on Substrate. Really in depth, probably take 10 hours to do but this is the core of what we would be doing: building a pallet for Substrate.
